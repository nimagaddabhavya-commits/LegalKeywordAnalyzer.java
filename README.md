# LegalKeywordAnalyzer.java
Legal Document Keyword Analyzer is a Java-based text analysis tool that scans legal documents and identifies the frequency of important legal terms such as rights, obligations, contracts, and privacy. The project demonstrates how basic natural language processing techniques can be applied to legal and civic contexts using core Java data structures.
This project is a Java console application designed to analyze legal text and highlight commonly used legal keywords. Users can input a legal document or passage, and the program reports how often key legal terms appear.

The goal of this project is to explore how programming can support legal analysis by organizing and extracting meaningful information from text. It emphasizes clarity, ethical awareness, and foundational Java programming concepts.
